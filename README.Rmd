An R package to help with retrieving tidy [understat](https://understat.com/) data.

## Install

`understatr` is not likely to be submitted to CRAN. Get it from GitHub:

```{r install_dev, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github('ewenme/understatr')
```

## Use

```{r load}
library(understatr)
```

### Get player stats for a team's roster:

```{r example}
get_team_player_stats(team_url = "https://understat.com/team/Newcastle_United/2018")
```

## Disclaimer

While there is no official notice on the site condoning web scraping activity, Understat's [support](support@understat.com) have previously confirmed (via e-mail exchange, 8th November 2018) that their data is free to use for non-commercial purposes. This stance is subject to change. Also, be polite and attribute the source.
